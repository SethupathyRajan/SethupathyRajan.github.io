        <center><h1>Subroutines in MIPS Assembly</h1></center><br>
        <p>
            It is common in programming to run a specific task repeatedly with varied data values. Rather than repeating the same block of code, we may use something called a subroutine, which is a chunk of code that can be executed as many times as necessary. 

        </p><br>
        <h2>Some Important Keys are:</h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Program Counter: It is a register in the CPU. Stores the address of the next instruction to be carried out</li>
            <li>Stack Pointer : It is a register that stores the address of the next location in the stack</li>
            <li>Stack: It is an area of memory used to store the contents of the program counter during subroutines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To save space, just one copy of a code block is stored in memory, even if it is utilized frequently in the program. The block of code can be used simply by branching to the subroutine's starting address. This is known as a subroutine call, and the instruction doing this calling is called the call instruction.</p>
        <p>When a subroutine is called, the contents of the PC are copied to the stack and the stack pointer decreases.</p><br>
        <p>The program must return and continue execution after the subroutine has been completed, and the return instruction can help with this. When a subroutine is finished, the program must return to the intended position. A subroutine can be located anywhere in the program and is performed by a call instruction. While the Call instruction is being executed, the updated program counter points to the position where the calling program resumes execution. Therefore, to allow a proper return to the calling program, the Call instruction needs to store the contents of the program counter.</p>
        <p>When a subroutine is returned, the contents of the stack are copied to the PC and the stack pointer increases. </p><br>

        <h2>Parameter Passing</h2>
        <p>When invoking a subroutine, the program must give the arguments, such as operands or addresses, for the computation. The function then returns additional parameters with the computation results. The exchange of information between a calling program and a subroutine is known as parameter passing. There are numerous ways to pass parameters. Parameters can be stored in registers or memory for easy access by subroutines. Alternatively, the settings might be stored on the processor stack.</p><br>
        <h3>Example</h3>

        <h2>Nested Subroutines and Processor Stack</h2>
        <p>Subroutine Nesting is a programming technique in which one subroutine calls another subroutine. The return address of the second call is placed in the registration link by filling in the previous data. Therefore it is necessary to store the content of the link. Otherwise, the back address of the first subroutine will be lost. Finally, the last subroutine completes its calculations and returns to the calling subprogram. The first address returned is the last address generated by the nested call. Return addresses are created and used using the last-in, first-out method. This specifies that the loopback address associated with the subroutine call should be sent to the processor stack.</p><br>
        <h3>Example:</h3>

        <h2>Stack Frame</h2>
        <p>Subroutines employ stacks to store local variables and pass parameters. When recursion takes place, the stack is continuously built. Each subroutine uses a certain allotted space in the stack, which is called a stack frame, and the pointer that references the stack frame of a given subroutine is called the frame pointer.</p><br>
